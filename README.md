# Medi-Connect

MediConnect is a mobile application designed to help users find rare medications across the island. Often, certain medicines are unavailable in rural areas but can be found in cities. With this in mind, MediConnect allows pharmacies to upload their product catalogs to the app. Patients can easily search for the medicines they need and contact the pharmacy directly through the app. This convenient tool bridges the gap between patients and pharmacies, ensuring easier access to essential medications regardless of location.
